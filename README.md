# Image Filtering using OpenCL

This is the implementation of 4 image filters, including Box Filter, Gaussian Filter, Laplacian Filter and Sharpenning Filter using OpenCL and C++.





| Filtering Method  |  Speed on CPU (ms) | Speen on GPU (ms) | Image Resolution |
| :---:             | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Box Filter        | 3.26 | 0.93 | 800*600 |
| Gaussian Filter   | 3.17 | 0.95 | 800*600 |
| Laplacian Filter  | 3.55 | 0.92 | 800*600 |
| Sharpening Filter | 3.18 | 0.92 | 800*600 |
